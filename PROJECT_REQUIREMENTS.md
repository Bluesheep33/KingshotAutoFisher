Check the context first.

I want an automation script for doing a fishing attempt in the Kingshot fishing event. The script should:
1. Dodge obstacles when going down so that it can reach the maximum depth possible.
2. Register all fishes/mermaids/chests/items when going down.
3. Recognize when it is at max depth and calculate the best things it should catch when going up bases on the user's priorities.
4. Catch these things when going up while avoiding the other things.
5. Pause the attempt if it recognizes that it accidentally caught something that it should not have caught or is going back up before reaching max depth.
