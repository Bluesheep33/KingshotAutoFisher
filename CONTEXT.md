Kingshot is a mobile strategy game that has a fishing event that occurs every 4 weeks. In this event players can earn rewards.

The game can be emulated on a pc and be controlled with a mouse.

Here is a summary of an attempt in the fishing event:

There's two stages of an attempt, first the line goes down, then it comes back up. 
You can tap and drag to control the line when it's going down and up.
There's multiple fishes, chests, items and mermaids that can be caught and give a different amount of points. 
All of them only move horizontally, but at different speeds and patterns.
Avoid everything when the line is going down, otherwise the line will go back up immediately.
When the line is going up, try to catch the relevant fishes/items/mermaids/chests according to what you are prioritizing.
You can restart the attempt at any time by clicking the pause button in the top right corner.


### How the Kingshot Fishing Event Works

At its core, the fishing event is easy to understand but challenging to master. You start by tapping and dragging your finger across the screen to cast your line. The deeper your line goes, the more fish and items you can catch. Once the line is reeled back, you collect whatever you managed to snag.

You are given a fixed number of attempts each day. These attempts refresh over time, which means you should log in consistently to avoid missing chances. Each fish or item caught gives you points, which add up toward rewards.

When I was first learning, I underestimated how important it was to time my casts correctly. A bad cast can waste an attempt, and with limited tries each day, every single one matters. Luckily, you can restart a cast if you feel it is going wrong, which saves your chances from being wasted.

### Fishing Gear and Upgrades

One of the most exciting parts of the event is upgrading your fishing gear. Each piece of equipment has a direct impact on your results.

● Fishing line increases the depth you can reach. The deeper you go, the more valuable the fish you can catch.

● Hook capacity determines how many fish or items you can bring up in one attempt. A bigger hook means more points per cast.

● Bait influences what type of fish you attract. Using the right bait can help you target high-value fish.

Points you earn during the event can be used to upgrade your equipment. The more you upgrade, the better your chances of hitting big scores. There are also special items that temporarily boost your abilities or open access to exclusive areas, such as the Sunken Treasure Hunt. This is one of my favorite features because it adds variety and makes the fishing event feel fresh every time it returns.

In my experience, I found it best to first upgrade my fishing line so I could reach the deeper fish, then balance hook capacity to maximize my catch per cast. Without upgrades, you will feel stuck catching only basic fish near the surface.

### Rewards and Leaderboard Prizes

The Kingshot fishing event is not just about catching fish for fun. It is about stacking up points to climb the leaderboard and claim rewards.

● Standard rewards: You can exchange points for permanent fishing gear upgrades or consumables.

● Special modes: Unlocking Sunken Treasure Hunt gives you access to rare items and treasures that are unavailable anywhere else in the game.

● Leaderboard prizes: The top players in each fishing tournament win exclusive prizes that set them apart from casual participants.

These rewards are why the fishing event is worth taking seriously. When I managed to hit the leaderboard for the first time, I unlocked gear that gave me a significant advantage in future events. That feeling of achievement keeps the event exciting.

### Strategies for Success in the Fishing Event

From my time playing the event, I picked up a few strategies that made a big difference:

1. Prioritize high-value fish
 Not all fish give equal points. Target deeper fish or special event fish for maximum returns

2. Upgrade wisely
 Focus on fishing line and hook capacity early. Depth allows you to reach valuable fish, and hook upgrades maximize each attempt.

3. Use the right bait
 Experiment with bait types to find which attracts the fish you need for the highest points.

4. Restart bad casts
 If you can tell a cast will not catch much, restart it before it completes. This avoids wasting attempts.

5. Stay consistent
 Since attempts refresh daily, logging in and fishing regularly is the best way to stay competitive.

When I started applying these strategies, I went from earning only basic rewards to consistently placing higher in tournaments. It is a game of patience, timing, and smart upgrades.


### Personal Tips

Fishing Tournament
Fishing Tips

Use your Ocean Prospector first

This will help you gain enough points to upgrade your Line, Hook and Sinker and make subsequent casts more profitable

If you mess up, go to the top right and click the pause button to retreat and try again

You cannot find rare mermaids or chests in regular fishing, only in Ocean prospectors

Grab all glowing fish when you are regular fishing

Mermaids in distress (wrapped in seaweed) give you a points multiplier (5-10%)

Use your Horn of the Tides while regular fishing, they are a waste in Ocean Prospector

Use the Horn of the Tide only with your last few attempts during the event. That way you ensure that you are only using the horn on fishes that you would have otherwise not gotten. if you use the horns at the start and get the same fish later on as well on a normal attempt, then the use of that horn would have been in vain.

And a tip to make the fishing itself easier: stick to one of the edges of your screen when possible, that way you only have to worry about fishes coming from one side.

Always grab the chests that you find as well, they can give valuable items that you can use outside the event (e.g. speedups)

Prioritization of upgrades: line > hook > sinker
